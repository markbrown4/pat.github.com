The "Comedy Festival":http://www.comedyfestival.com.au is running again here in Melbourne - which is one of my favourite times of the year. Just saw my first show this afternoon - *Daniel Kitson* and *Gavin Osborn*'s _The Ballad of Rodger & Grace_. In short, it was amazing, funny, heartwarming and beautiful.

Kitson is a fantastic wordsmith, sometimes using words that don't get used enough, and using otherwise common words in clever and different ways. Osborn provided a touching and emotive soundtrack to the story Kitson wove, filling in a different perspective.

I know I've "raved about Kitson before":http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/daniel_kitson,_comedy_god - and I've got a different show of his for this festival that I'm yet to see, so I likely will rave again soon - but do yourself a favour and go catch one of his shows (this one is only running for a few more days, but his solo festival show runs until mid April). He is one of the finest comedic talents out there - and a masterful storyteller to boot. Osborn's music just adds to the brilliance.
