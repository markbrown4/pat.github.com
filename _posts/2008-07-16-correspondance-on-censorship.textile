About six months ago, I "sent a letter":http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/internet_censorship_in_australia to the Australian Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (yes, that's a mouthful), *Stephen Conroy*, raising some concerns with the ISP filtering the Government was proposing.

A few weeks ago, I received "a response":http://pastie.textmate.org/235084. It's overly long, filled with spin and "cruft":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft, but hey, that's better than nothing. There's still some questions unanswered though, and new ones raised, so here's my response to the good senator. Fingers crossed for a faster reply.

To the Honourable Stephen Conroy,

Thank you for your letter dated 26 June 2008, replying to my own concerns sent to your office in January. I appreciate the extensive details on the current Government's plans for cyber-safety, although I feel a couple of my concerns weren't addressed. Namely:

* The reasoning behind using an opt-out filter instead of an opt-in filter;
* Acknowledgement that this filter will slow down the internet in Australia; and
* Confirmation that it is the ACMA, not the Government, that determines what sites are filtered.

Secondly, I have some questions from what you outlined in your letter:

* Who decides the participants in the Consultative Working Group and Youth Advisory Group?
* What defines success and/or failure for the ISP filtering pilot?
* Was there consultation with the industry about the feasibility of the filtering? Or is that consultation limited to how best to implement it?

Again, thank you for your response, and I look forward to the continuation of this discussion.

Kind regards,

Patrick Allan
