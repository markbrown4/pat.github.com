I'm slowly making my way through Richard Florida's "_The Rise of the Creative Class_":http://creativeclass.com/ (yes, I should have read it a couple of years ago, I know), and came across a nice quote - paraphrasing the thoughts of "Joel Mokyr":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Mokyr, that I thought was rather apt when considering the stupidity and greed of the mobile phone carriers in Australia (in general, and in regard to Apple's iPhone):

<blockquote>"Technical creativity has tended to rise and then fade dramatically at various times in various cultures, when social and economic institutions turn rigid and act against it."</blockquote>

You could argue Telstra, Optus and Vodafone aren't doing anything _against_ technical creativity, sure - but they're certainly not doing anything "_for_ it either":http://www.smh.com.au/news/iphone-insider/iphone-charges-watchdog-investigates/2008/07/21/1216492331116.html?page=fullpage.

If you want a much better, more detailed write-up, go read "what John Allsop":http://www.webdirections.org/blog/iphone-in-australia-now-for-the-bad-news/ "has to say":http://www.webdirections.org/blog/australian-consumer-watchdog-and-data-pricing-plans/.
