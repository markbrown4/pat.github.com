Here's one small filesystem tweak that's been handy as I've been slowly rebuilding my development environment on Leopard over the last couple of days. It's to get "Sphinx":http://www.sphinxsearch.com working - there was no problems with compilation or installation, but when I ran searchd or indexer, it complained about not finding the mysql libraries:

<pre><code>dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/indexer
  Reason: image not found</code></pre>

Now, the expected file path is incorrect - it shouldn't have the second 'mysql'. My attempts to change that with various configuration flags didn't work, so I cheated, and added the folder as a symbolic link:

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql</code></pre>

Suggestions of a cleaner solution always welcome.
