Following in the steps of the Australian Rails Camps, it's now time to announce "the first UK edition":http://railscamp08.org. Running from Friday the 15th to Monday the 18th of August, it will be an extended weekend of hacking, talking, eating, drinking and games, with a bunch of smart and passionate Ruby developers.

Even though the name is "Rails Camp", previous camps have included talks on topics from Merb to Rack to Extreme Programming - all topics somewhat related to Ruby are welcome.

If you'd like to come along, I'd recommend "registering":http://railscampuk.eventwax.com/rails-camp-uk/register soon, as there's a very limited number of places.
