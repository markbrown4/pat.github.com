In case you've not been watching every commit carefully flow through "Thinking Sphinx on GitHub":http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tree/master - PostgreSQL support has been added. I've done a little bit of testing, and I've had some excellent support from Bj√∂rn Andreasson and "Tim Riley":http://log.openmonkey.com/, so I feel it's ready for people to start kicking the tires.

I'm no PostgreSQL expert - I definitely fall into the n00b category - so if you think there's better ways to do what I'm doing, would love to hear them.
