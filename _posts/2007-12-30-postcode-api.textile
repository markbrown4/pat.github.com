A couple of weeks ago I quickly coded a basic webservice - using "Merb":http://merbivore.com - for Australian Postcode data. Just got hosting for it sorted out last night, so now I can blog about it.

h3. "Postie":http://auspostie.com

The emphasis is on simple - you can search by postcode or suburb, and get the data back either as a HTML page, XML, or JSON. That's pretty much it. The request urls aren't complicated, either:

* "auspostie.com/Brunswick":http://auspostie.com/Brunswick
* "auspostie.com/Brunswick.js":http://auspostie.com/Brunswick.js
* "auspostie.com/Brunswick.xml":http://auspostie.com/Brunswick.xml
* "auspostie.com/2782":http://auspostie.com/2782
* "auspostie.com/2782.js":http://auspostie.com/2782.js
* "auspostie.com/2782.xml":http://auspostie.com/2782.xml

Suburb requests use partial matching, so you don't need the full suburb name. If you want the JSON returned with the MIME type of @application/json@, use the @.json@ extension.

I've no plans at this point on using this, but perhaps it's useful for someone out there - if so, would love to hear about it.
