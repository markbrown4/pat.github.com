I've just started my round-the-world conferences-and-holiday adventure, and the first stop is RailsConf in Portland - so if you're in town and see me wandering around looking rather cluelessly, please say hi.

Also, in case you're on the Twitter bandwagon, you'll find me with the creative nickname of "pat":http://twitter.com/pat.
