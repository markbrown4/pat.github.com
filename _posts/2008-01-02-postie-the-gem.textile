An addition to "auspostie.com":http://auspostie.com, prompted by "Dr Nic's":http://drnicwilliams.com/ suggestion in the comments of the earlier blog post - the "postie gem":http://postie.rubyforge.org. It allows easy parsing of Postie search results, and also provides a command-line tool for searching.

By suburb:

<pre><code>postie Brunswick</code></pre>

By postcode:

<pre><code>postie 3070</code></pre>

To install:

<pre><code>sudo gem install postie</code></pre>

To use within your own ruby code:

<pre><code>require 'postie'

Postie::Locality.find("Melbourne")</code></pre>

Again, extremely simple, but just makes access to the data that little bit easier.

Now, what would be really cool is a Quicksilver plugin that queries the API. Any volunteers to code that up?
