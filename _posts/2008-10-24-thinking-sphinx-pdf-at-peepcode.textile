A quick note to let anyone using (or interested in using) "Sphinx":http://sphinxsearch.com/ and/or "Thinking Sphinx":http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/ that "my Peepcode PDF":http://peepcode.com/products/thinking-sphinx-pdf has just been published, and contains a wealth of information on how to mix Sphinx with ActiveRecord (via Rails or Merb).

It's been great working with "Geoffrey Grosenbach":http://topfunky.com/ to get this written up, and I'm pretty stoked to see the final results - hopefully others will enjoy it as well.

Also, a massive thank you to all the contributors to Thinking Sphinx - it wouldn't be quite so cool if it wasn't for all the patches (facilitated by "GitHub's forking":http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/network/members).
