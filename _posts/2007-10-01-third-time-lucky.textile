Right, "here we go again":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI. Third time lucky.

That is, this is my third attempt at blogging. Hopefully it'll last longer and be more frequent than the last two tries. We'll just have to wait and see.

Massive thanks to "Aesthetically Loyal":http://aestheticallyloyal.com for the design of this site - it's made life much easier with getting this all online, and it's a nice change to be actually satisfied with the design of a website I've coded. (My ego's not as bad as the header image or domain name might suggest, by the way. Honest.)

Anyway, stay tuned for a few more blog posts - mainly Rails-related to start with (I've got a few plugins sitting around that deserve a post or two), as well as an updated header image.
